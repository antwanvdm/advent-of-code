# Advent of Code

I started [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in 2023, and I love it.
More than half of the puzzles are doable, some are very difficult but after a
lot of struggling doable. And than there's the remainder, no idea if I will even
be able to finish them. All puzzles have their assignments and input data included
in the folders per day. My solutions are included for the puzzles that I've finished,
or work in progress when I'm not done.

All puzzles are done in my favorite programming language, PHP. My fun with the puzzles,
the struggles, and key takeaways as a teacher are documented within a
[LinkedIn article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/advent-code-2024-teacherlife-antwan-van-der-mooren-oe0be/).
